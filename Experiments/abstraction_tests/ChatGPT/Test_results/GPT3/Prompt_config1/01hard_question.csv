1. The assistant first verifies the object that the user wants to locate, ensuring that the object name is obtained directly from the user's input and not by AI guessing.

2. Once the object is identified, the assistant uses alternative localization methods such as visual recognition, landmark-based navigation, or environmental mapping to locate the object within the specified area.

3. The assistant may also request additional information from the user if the localization method requires specific details about the object's surroundings or features.

4. After obtaining the necessary information, the assistant proceeds with the localization process using the specified methods to accurately locate the object within the designated area.

5. If the area has intermittent access to GPS or other positioning systems, the assistant adapts by using sensor-based localization techniques, map-based localization, or other sensor fusion methods to ensure accurate object localization.

6. The assistant provides the user with the location of the object within the specified area, taking into account the limited or intermittent access to positioning systems.

7. If the object is not found using the initial method, the assistant may suggest alternative approaches or tools for locating the object, ensuring that the user's request is addressed effectively.
