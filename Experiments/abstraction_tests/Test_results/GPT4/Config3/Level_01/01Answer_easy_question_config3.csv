4. **Julius von Sachs (1832-1897)**: He showed that chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis and that starch is produced in the chloroplasts during the process.

In the early 1970s, scientists such as Tom Bolton and Louise Webster, along with Paul Murdin, independently provided strong evidence that Cygnus X-1 was a black hole. They observed the motions of the companion star and deduced the presence of a massive, unseen object, which they concluded was a black hole.

Quinine, a natural alkaloid extracted from the bark of the cinchona tree, was used by indigenous people in South America long before it was introduced to Europe in the 17th century. The use of quinine became widespread as a treatment for malaria.

The discovery of synthetic antimalarial drugs began with Paul Ehrlich and Alfred Bertheim, who developed the first synthetic drug, Salvarsan, in 1910, although it was not specifically for malaria.
