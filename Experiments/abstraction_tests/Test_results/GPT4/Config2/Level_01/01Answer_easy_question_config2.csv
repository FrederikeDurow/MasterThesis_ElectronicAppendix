The key figures in the discovery and identification of Cygnus X-1 include:

1. **Tom Bolton** - In 1971, Canadian astronomer Tom Bolton, using the David Dunlap Observatory, provided compelling evidence that Cygnus X-1 was a black hole.
2. **Louise Webster and Paul Murdin** - Independently of Bolton, in 1972, these British astronomers from the Royal Greenwich Observatory also identified Cygnus X-1 as a black hole.

Their observations and analyses showed that the mass of the unseen companion in the system was too large to be a neutron star, leading to the conclusion that it must be a black hole.",[],[],CLARIFICATION,221,537,758,3.6782894134521484
