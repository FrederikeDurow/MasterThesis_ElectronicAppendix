3. **Jan Ingenhousz (1779)**: He demonstrated that light is essential for plants to produce oxygen and that this process happens in the green parts of the plant.

4. **Jean Senebier (1782)**: He showed that carbon dioxide is consumed by plants in the presence of light.

What is the speed of light in kilometers per hour?,"The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately \(299,792,458\) meters per second. To convert this to kilometers per hour (km/h):

1. Convert meters to kilometers: \(299,792,458 \, \text{meters} = 299,792.458 \, \text{kilometers}\)
2. Convert seconds to hours: \(1 \, \text{second} = \frac{1}{3600} \, \text{hours}\)

So, the speed of light in kilometers per hour is:
\[ 299,792.458 \, \text{km/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/hour} = 1,079,252,849 \, \text{km/h} \]
