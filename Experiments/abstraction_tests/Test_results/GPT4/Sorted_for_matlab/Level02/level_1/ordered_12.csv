Also Help me find a fruit that's a staple in many households.  Navigate to the customary sleeping area.,"I will handle these tasks step by step for you. Let's start with the first few tasks and proceed accordingly.

1. Take you to the garden.
2. Take you to the workshop.
3. Find a water bottle.

Let's start with these:

```json
{
  ""tool_uses"": [
    {
      ""recipient_name"": ""functions.go_to_area"",
      ""parameters"": {
        ""goal_area"": ""garden""
      }
    },
    {
      ""recipient_name"": ""functions.go_to_area"",

      ""parameters"": {
        ""object"": ""bottle""
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Next, I will look for a fruit frequently seen in fruit baskets (apple), then find a whiskered companion (cat), and then move to the garage where we store the vehicles.

```json
{
  ""tool_uses"": [
    {
      ""recipient_name"": ""functions.locate_object"",
      ""parameters"": {
        ""object"": ""apple""
      }
    },
    {
      ""recipient_name"": ""functions.locate_object"",
      ""parameters"": {
        ""object"": ""cat""
      }
    },
    {
      ""recipient_name"": ""functions.go_to_area"",
      ""parameters"": {
        ""goal_area"": ""garage""
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Then I will locate the device where perishable food items are kept (refrigerator), take you to the dining room, and journey to the household.

```json
{
  ""tool_uses"": [
    {
      ""recipient_name"": ""functions.locate_object"",

    {

    {

      ""parameters"": {
        ""goal_area"": ""home""
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Finally, I will search for a teddy bear, find a banana (a staple fruit), and navigate to the bedroom (customary sleeping area).

```json
{
  ""tool_uses"": [
    {
      ""recipient_name"": ""functions.locate_object"",
