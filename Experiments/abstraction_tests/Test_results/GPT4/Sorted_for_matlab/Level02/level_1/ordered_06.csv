I need a vessel for my ice cream. Afterwards Look around for a fruit that's a favorite of monkeys.  Could you locate a four-legged friend?  Take me to the backyard garden patio. Afterwards Can you lead me to the car parking spot? Also Advance to your residency.,"Okay, let's break down your requests and address them step by step.

1. Look for a vessel for ice cream (which I assume is a bowl).
2. Look for a fruit that monkeys favor (which is a banana).
3. Look for a four-legged friend (which could be a dog or a cat).
4. Take you to the backyard garden patio.
5. Lead you to the car parking spot (which I assume is the garage).
6. Advance to my residency.

Let's proceed with these tasks in parallel where possible.

### Step 1: Look for a bowl
### Step 2: Look for a banana
### Step 3: Look for a dog and a cat

I'll start by locating the objects simultaneously.

### Step 4: Navigation Tasks

Once the object location tasks are complete, we'll proceed with navigation.

Let's start with the object location tasks:

```json
{
  ""tool_uses"": [
    {
      ""recipient_name"": ""functions.locate_object"",
      ""parameters"": {
        ""object"": ""bowl""
      }
    },
    {
      ""recipient_name"": ""functions.locate_object"",
      ""parameters"": {
        ""object"": ""banana""
      }
    },
    {
      ""recipient_name"": ""functions.locate_object"",
      ""parameters"": {
        ""object"": ""dog""
      }
    },

      ""parameters"": {
        ""object"": ""cat""
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

After these tasks are done, I will proceed with:

### Step 5: Navigate to the garden
### Step 6: Navigate to the garage
### Step 7: Navigate home

I'll handle these navigation tasks in sequence after object location tasks are done. Let's start with the initial tasks.","['locate_object', 'locate_object', 'locate_object', 'locate_object', 'go_to_area', 'go_to_area', 'go_to_area']","['{""object"": ""bowl""}', '{""object"": ""banana""}', '{""object"": ""dog""}', '{""object"": ""cat""}', '{""goal_area"":""garden""}', '{""goal_area"":""garage""}', '{""goal_area"":""home""}']","['bowl', 'banana', 'dog', 'garden', 'garage', 'home']",FAILURE,"All requested tasks have been completed successfully:
