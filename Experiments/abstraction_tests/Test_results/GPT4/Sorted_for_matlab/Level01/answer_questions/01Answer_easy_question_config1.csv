However, it is primarily credited to James Prescott Joule, Rudolf Clausius, and Hermann von Helmholtz.

- **James Prescott Joule** conducted experiments that established the mechanical equivalent of heat, showing that energy could be converted from one form to another but not created or destroyed.

- **Rudolf Clausius** contributed to the mathematical formulation of the first law and introduced the concept of internal energy.

- **Hermann von Helmholtz** independently arrived at the principle of conservation of energy and applied it to various physical systems.

Their combined efforts led to the formulation and acceptance of the first law of thermodynamics.",[],[],CLARIFICATION,154,307,461,2.1542611122131348
